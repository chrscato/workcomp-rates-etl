## üìã Quick Start Guide

### For ETL1 (Most Common):
```bash
# Basic run with memory fixes
python ETL/scripts/01_run_etl1_main.py --payer aetna --force-cleanup

# Test with conservative settings
python ETL/scripts/04_test_etl1_memory.py

# Monitor memory during processing
python ETL/scripts/03_test_memory_monitor.py
```

### For ETL3:
```bash
# Test memory optimizations first
python ETL/scripts/test_etl3_memory.py

# Run main ETL3 pipeline
python ETL/scripts/run_etl3.py

# Custom memory settings for constrained systems
python ETL/scripts/run_etl3.py --chunk-size 500 --memory-limit 512
```

## üóëÔ∏è Removed Scripts

The following scripts were removed as they were duplicates or outdated:

- ‚ùå `run_etl1_memory_optimized.py` ‚Üí Duplicate of `01_run_etl1_main.py`
- ‚ùå `patch_merge_simple.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)
- ‚ùå `patch_merge_polars.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)
- ‚ùå `patch_merge_incremental.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)
- ‚ùå `patch_merge_temp_files.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)
- ‚ùå `patch_merge_temp_files_batched.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)
- ‚ùå `finish_fact_rate_merge.py` ‚Üí Outdated (superseded by fixed ETL1)

## üîß Memory Optimization Features

All ETL1 scripts now include:
- **Batched Processing**: Process files in small batches to avoid memory spikes
- **Conservative Chunk Sizes**: 1000 rows per chunk (vs 5000 before)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Clean up temp files and force garbage collection
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and recovery mechanisms

## üìä Expected Performance

With the memory fixes:
- **Memory Usage**: Stable under 1GB (vs 2GB+ before)
- **Processing Time**: 2-4 hours for 13.4M records
- **Success Rate**: Should complete without memory errors
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 rows (5x smaller than before)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Memory Errors**: Use `04_test_etl1_memory.py` to test with ultra-conservative settings
2. **File Locks**: Use `05_cleanup_locked_files.py` to clean up locked files
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Use `03_test_memory_monitor.py` to track memory usage
4. **Configuration Issues**: Use `02_run_etl1_advanced.py` with custom settings
